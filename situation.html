        <h3>Climate Change: Regional Impacts</h3>
        <p>Changes in Earth's climate have different effects in different areas of the world. Some places<br /> will warm much more than others, some regions will receive more rainfall, while others are<br /> exposed to more frequent droughts. Regional changes in temperature and precipitation<br /> are having impacts on people and ecosystems. Animals that are not able to tolerate<br /> changes in climate and are not able to move into new areas are threatened by extinction.</p>

        <h3>Low-lying Coastal Regions and Rising Seas</h3>
        <p>Not surprisingly, rising sea level is expected to have adverse effects on coastal regions and<br /> islands worldwide. However, the impacts will differ depending on the topography of the land<br /> and its susceptibility to flooding.
            <br /><br />Some low-lying coastal regions will be subject to more frequent flooding or even permanent<br /> inundation. Large areas in the countries of Bangladesh and The Netherlands, along with the<br /> U.S. state of Florida and the city of New Orleans are only slightly above sea level, and thus<br /> are at great risk of even slight increases in sea level. Some small island nations in the Pacific<br /> are at such low elevations that they are in danger of being wiped off the map entirely as the<br /> water rises.
           <br /><br /> Higher sea levels will hasten the erosion of beaches and other types of terrain along the<br /> shoreline. Salty water will seep further inland in estuaries and brackish marshes, altering<br /> ecosystems (many of which serve as nurseries for ocean-going fish and other aquatic creatures).

      <div class="Hurricane">
        <h3>Hurricane Prone Regions</h3>
        <p>Regions of the world that are already prone to tropical cyclones (also<br /> known as hurricanes and typhoons) may see more impacts from them<br /> in the future. These storms derive their energy from warm ocean waters,<br /> so their winds become more intense as sea surface temperatures warm. Hurricanes<br /> are also able to carry more water vapor in a warmer climate, causing more rain which<br /> can cause flooding when they make landfall. Also, flooding from storm surge during hurricanes<br /> will wash further inland as sea level rises due to climate change. 
            Hurricanes occur in six<br /> major regions worldwide: the North Atlantic, the Northeastern Pacific, the Northwestern Pacific,<br /> the Southwestern Pacific, and the North and South Indian Ocean.<br /> Each of these regions may be affected differently by changes to storm patterns caused by<br /> global warming. Hurricane seasons may start earlier and end later, providing more time for<br /> storms to occur. Storms may move into higher latitudes as ocean waters warm. Hurricanes<br /> may form in places where they hadn't before. </p>

      <div class="Mountain">
        <h3>High Mountain Regions</h3>
        <p>Almost all of the world's mountain or alpine glaciers are receding, a trend that is likely<br /> to continue in the years ahead. As glaciers shrink, and in some places disappear, human<br /> communities and ecosystems that rely on glacial meltwater as a supply of fresh water. In<br /> some regions, people depend almost entirely on glaciers for the water they use in towns,<br /> cities, and for agriculture. Much of northern India gets water from Himalayan glaciers, while<br /> large portions of Chile rely on glaciers in the Andes for water. Less water can lead to<br /> changes in ecosystems and a greater incidence of water-borne diseases. In other<br /> mountainous areas, snow typically builds up during the winter and melts in the spring and<br /> summer, flowing down rivers. But warmer temperatures increase the risk of river flooding as<br /> snow melts faster. The changes to snow and glacial ice in mountain regions threatens the<br /> extinction of species that live in unique high-altitude environments. </p>

        <h3>Regions Affected by El Niño and Other Patterns in the Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>Cycles such as El Niño and La Niña events and seasonal monsoons in India may change as<br /> the climate warms. Scientists are still trying to improve models of these events, so<br /> predictions of how they may change in the future are somewhat speculative. Disruptions of<br /> the normal patterns, particularly of the monsoons, could affect many millions of people in<br /> areas like India and Bangladesh. El Niño and La Niña affect the Pacific Ocean and<br /> surrounding areas, but scientists are discovering that they also may have an influence on<br /> other areas of the world as well.</p>

      <div class="Polar">
        <h3>The Polar Regions</h3>
        <p>The Arctic and parts of Antarctica are warming much more quickly than the global average,<br /> a trend that is expected to continue. The extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean has been<br /> decreasing rapidly. Some models project a complete loss of sea ice in the summertime in<br /> the Arctic by the middle of the 21st Century. Glaciers and ice sheets in Antarctica and<br /> Greenland are melting too. 
           <br /><br /> Permafrost (frozen ground) usually provides a solid platform for buildings and roadways<br /> in the Arctic. It is solid enough for animals like caribou to migrate over. But thawing permafrost<br /> creates mushy ground, disrupting wildlife and human activities. Also, the thawing of<br /> permafrost releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.</p>
