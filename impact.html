        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>Changes to water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives.
            <br />Flooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th<br /> century, there are both stronger and more frequent abnormally heavy precipitation events across most<br /> of the United States.
            <br /><br />Conversely, drought is also becoming more common, particularly in the Western United States.<br />Humans are using more water, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out,<br /> higher air temperatures cause plants to lose, or transpire, more water, meaning farmers must give<br /> them more water. Both highlight the need for more water in places where supplies are dwindling.<br />
            Snowpack is an important source of fresh water for many people. As the snow melts, fresh water<br /> becomes available for use, especially in regions like the Western United States where there is not<br /> much precipitation in warmer months. But as temperatures warm, there is less snow<br /> overall and snow begins to melt earlier in the year, meaning snowpack may not<br /> be a reliable source of water for the entire warm and dry seasons. </p>

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>Our food supply depends on climate and weather conditions. Although farmers and researchers may<br /> be able to adapt some agricultural techniques and technologies or develop new ones, some changes<br /> will be difficult to manage. Increased temperatures, drought and water stress, diseases, and weather<br /> extremes create challenges for the farmers and ranchers who put food on our tables.
            <br /><br />Human farm workers can suffer from heat-related health issues, like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart<br /> attacks. Rising temperatures and heat stress can also harm livestock. </p>

        <h3>Human health</h3>
        <p>Climate change is already impacting human health. Changes in weather and climate patterns can put<br /> lives at risk. Heat is one of the most deadly weather phenomena. As ocean temperatures rise,<br /> hurricanes are getting stronger and wetter, which can cause direct and indirect deaths. Dry conditions<br /> lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks. Higher incidences of flooding can lead<br /> to the spread of waterborne diseases, injuries, and chemical hazards. As geographic ranges of mosquitoes<br /> and ticks expand, they can carry diseases to new locations.
            <br /><br />The most vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, people with preexisting health conditions,<br /> outdoor workers, people of color, and people with low income, are at an even higher risk because of<br /> the compounding factors from climate change. But public health groups can work with local<br /> communities to help people understand and build resilience to climate change health impacts.</p>

        <h3>The enviornment</h3>
        <p>Climate change will continue to have a significant impact on ecosystems and organisms, though they are<br /> not impacted equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate<br /> change, as it is warming at least twice the rate of the global average and melting land ice sheetsoffsite link and<br /> glaciersoffsite link contribute dramatically to sea level rise around the globe.
            <br /><br />Some living things are able to respond to climate change; some plants are blooming earlier and some<br /> species may expand their geographic range. But these changes are happening too fast for many other<br /> plants and animals as increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns stress ecosystems.<br /> Some invasive or nuisance species, like lionfish and ticks, may thrive in even more places because<br /> of climate change. 
            <br /><br />Changes are also occurring in the ocean. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is<br /> released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, the water is becoming more<br /> acidic, affecting marine life. Sea levels are rising due to thermal expansion, in addition to melting ice<br /> sheets and glaciers, putting coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge.
            <br /><br />The compounding effects of climate change are leading to many changes in ecosystems. Coral reefs are<br /> vulnerable to many effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching, stronger<br /> hurricanes can destroy reefs, and sea level rise can cause corals to be smothered by sediment. Coral reef<br /> ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive.</p>

        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Physical infrastructure includes bridges, roads, ports, electrical grids, broadband internet, and other parts<br /> of our transportation and communication systems. It is often designed to be in use for years or decades,<br /> and many communities have infrastructure that was designed without future climate in mind. But even<br /> newer infrastructures can be vulnerable to climate change. 
            <br /><br />Extreme weather events that bring heavy rains, floods, wind, snow, or temperature changes can stress<br /> existing structures and facilities. Increased temperatures require more indoor cooling, which can put stress<br /> on an energy grid. Sudden heavy rainfall can lead to flooding that shuts down highways and major<br /> business areas. 
            <br /><br />Nearly 40% of the United States population lives in coastal counties, meaning millions of people will be<br /> impacted by sea level rise. Coastal infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, water supplies, and much more,<br /> is at risk. Sea level rise can also lead to coastal erosion and high-tide flooding. Some communities are<br /> projected to possibly end up at or below sea level by 2100 and will face decisions around managed<br /> retreat and climate adaptation. 
            <br /><br />Many communities are not yet prepared to face climate-related threats. Even within a community, some<br /> groups are more vulnerable to these threats than others. Going forward, it is important for communities<br /> to invest in resilient infrastructure that will be able to withstand future climate risks. Researchers are<br /> studying current and future impacts of climate change on communities and can offer recommendations on<br /> best practices. Resilience education is vitally important for city planners, emergency managers, educators,<br /> communicators, and all other community members to prepare for climate change.</p>
