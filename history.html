            <h2>1938 - Proof that global temperatures are rising</h2>
            <p class="left">A little-known amateur scientist called Guy Callendar makes history by discovering the planet<br /> has warmed
               In 1938, steam engineer Callendar decided to take a break from his day<br /> job and began painstakingly collecting records from 147 weather stations across the world.<br /> Doing all his calculations by hand, he discovered that global temperatures had risen 0.3°C<br /> over the previous 50 years. 
               Callendar argued that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from<br /> industry were responsible for global warming. However, this was largely ignored by other<br /> scientists who didn’t believe that humans could impact such a large system as the climate. 
              <br /> Remarkably, despite his crude methods, Callendar’s estimates of global warming were extremely<br />accurate and in line with modern assessments.</p>

            <h2>1958 - CO2 levels are rising, and fossil fuels are to blame</h2>
            <p class="left">Dr Charles David Keeling provides the first evidence that CO2 levels are rising.<br />
                 In 1958, a young postgraduate geochemist called Charles David Keeling decided<br />to compare the amounts of CO2in water and air. 
                 Nobody had ever really tried to<br /> measure the level of CO2 in the atmosphere before, so there was no off-the-shelf<br /> equipment he could use. 
                 He designed his own apparatus and set off to a weather<br /> observation station on the top of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. Once there,<br /> he took meticulous measurements every day and within five years he had provided<br /> the first unequivocal proof that CO2 concentrations were rising.
                 What’s more, by<br /> analysing the CO2 in his samples, Dr Keeling was able to attribute this rise to the<br /> use of fossil fuels. 
                 Although some scientists in the 19th century had argued that<br />burning fossil fuels could increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere, these concerns had remained<br /> largely hypothetical. 
                 Dr Keeling’s discovery was one of the most important scientific<br /> works of the 20th century. Since then, daily readings at Mauna Loa have continued<br /> almost uninterrupted for more than 60 years. The 'Keeling Curve', which documents changes<br /> in CO2 levels over time, is the longest continuous record of CO2 concentrations in the world.</p>

            <h2>1967 - Earth’s changing climate modelled for first time</h2>
            <p class="left">Scientists create the first computer model of planet Earth’s climate. The model<br /> predicts that doubling concentrations of CO2 could raise global temperatures<br /> by 2°C
                In 1967, researchers Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald produced<br />the world’s first accurate computer model of planet Earth’s climate.
                The model<br />looked at all the different components that contribute to climate,<br /> including the atmosphere, oceans and clouds, and the relationships between them. 
                <br />It even allowed researchers to adjust levels of CO2 to see what impact this would have<br /> on global temperatures. 
                 Manabe and Wetherald wrote that: 
                 ‘According to our estimate,<br /> a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature<br /> of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2°C.’ 
                 Measurements from<br /> the pre-industrial revolution through to today match that prediction extremely well.<br /> Since the 1880s we have increased CO2 by about 50%, and temperatures have increased by 1.1°C. 
                 <br />Syukuro Manabe is one of three scientists to have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics<br /> for his work on understanding complex systems, such as the Earth's climate.
                Supercomputer empowers<br /> next generation of climate models 
                Unlike Manabe and Wetherald, today's scientists have access to a<br /> huge amount of climate data from satellites. However, the computing power needed to process,<br />that data is astronomical. For example, the current Sentinel Earth observation satellites produce<br /> 10 terabytes of data every day which is the equivalent to data from 8.7 million WhatsApp messages<br /> going through the network every minute!
                This is where the JASMIN supercomputer comes in.<br /> JASMIN provides environmental scientists with access to very large sets of environmental data,<br /> which are typically too big for them to download to their own computers. It can also reduce the<br /> time it takes to test new ideas, as well as give results in hours rather than months.<br /> JASMIN is operated by the Science & Technology Facilities Council’s (STFC) RAL Space Centre<br /> for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) on behalf of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).</p>

            <h2>1968 - Scientist predicts melting ice caps</h2>
            <p class="left">Dr John Mercer, a glaciologist at Ohio State University in Columbus, warns that<br /> global warming could cause Antarctic ice sheets to collapse, leading to a disastrous<br /> rise in sea levels

                In 1968, Dr Mercer was conducting fieldwork at the Reedy Glacier<br /> in West Antarctica when he discovered evidence of a former freshwater lake, 1,400<br /> metres high up in the Transantarctic Mountains. 
                Dr Mercer took that as evidence that<br /> the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet had once melted away, something that previously<br />had been thought to be impossible. 
                His landmark paper found evidence that sea levels<br /> rose six metres in the previous interglacial period, around 120,000 years ago.<br />Temperatures at that time were 6-7°C higher than they are today. 
                In his study,<br /> Dr Mercer called the West Antarctic Ice Sheet a 'uniquely vulnerable and unstable body of ice'.
               <br /> He warned that current atmospheric warming could once more cause the ice shelves to<br /> disintegrate, causing a sea level rise of about five metres. 
                It took a while for his warning to take hold.<br /> However, this changed when, in 1995 the massive Larsen A ice shelf collapsed.<br /> The B ice shelf followed in 2002, and then in 2017 there was a major rift in Larsen C.<br />In 2014, a team of scientists reported that the loss of ice in the Amundsen Sea Embayment had accelerated and appeared 'unstoppable'.</p>

            <h2>1969 - Earth’s temperature measured with satellites for first time</h2>
            <p class="left">NASA’s Nimbus III satellite is launched into orbit – it provides the world’s first accurate measurement of global atmospheric temperatures
                The Nimbus satellites revolutionised how scientists study the Earth’s climate, weather systems and atmosphere
                First launched in 1964, over the course of 30 years the series of satellites provided us with never-before-seen data on global temperatures, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ozone layer, as well as sea ice thickness. It also allowed scientists to develop computer models that could forecast weather a week, or even two weeks, in advance, virtually impossible beforehand.
                The Nimbus III satellite was the first to include instruments that could measure atmospheric temperature. This provided an independent satellite record confirming that the Earth’s lower atmosphere was warming. 
                New generation of climate satellites
                Today’s satellites are of course capable of more sophisticated measurements. For instance, huge advances in measuring global surface temperatures have been made by British scientists at RAL Space. RAL Space carry out world-class science research and technology development, with significant involvement in more than 210 instruments on missions to date.
                Since the 1980s, RAL Space scientists and engineers have helped develop and calibrate the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series, considered to be one of the most accurate remote sensing instruments in the world. The ATSR can measure sea and land surface temperatures to unprecedented accuracy. 
                RAL Space also helped develop the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) for the Sentinel satellites, which form part of the European Union's Copernicus Earth observation programme. The satellites are providing us with an extraordinary picture of how Earth’s climate is changing.</p>

            <h2>1985 - Drilling 150,000 years deeper into the ice</h2>
            <p class="left">Ice cores extracted from Antarctica confirm that CO2 and temperature have gone up and down together over the past 150,000 years 
                Ice cores provide key information about what the Earth’s climate was like in the past.  
                Bubbles sealed in the ice provide a unique snapshot of the atmosphere at the time. Scientists can also work out what surface temperatures were like in the past by analysing the ratio of ‘heavy’ atoms of oxygen and hydrogen. 
                The deeper you dig, the further back in time you go. So, when a team of French and former Soviet scientists extracted an Antarctic ice core over 2,000 metres long in 1985, they were able to tell what atmospheric conditions were like 150,000 years ago. 
                In 1998 the team extracted an even longer ice core, extending the climate record back to 420,000 years ago. 
                Both cores showed a clear relationship between levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases and Antarctic temperature over time. As greenhouse gases had gone up, so had temperatures. 
                What’s more, they showed that present levels of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere are above anything seen in the past 420,000 years. 
                In 2004, ice core scientists at British Antarctic Survey (BAS) were part of a team that extracted a three-kilometre ice core from the Antarctic. This core contains a record of the Earth’s climate stretching back 800,000 years, giving us by far the oldest continuous climate record yet obtained from ice cores. 
                Together Antarctic ice cores show us that the concentration of CO2 was stable over the last millennium until the early 19th century. It then started to rise, and its concentration is now nearly 50% higher than it was before the industrial revolution.</p>

            <h2>1988 - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) heralds a new era of climate research</h2>
            <p>The IPCC provides policymakers with regular scientific assessments on the current state of knowledge about climate change

                Established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body responsible for assessing the science related to climate change. 
                So far, the IPCC has published five Assessment Reports written by the world’s most renowned experts on climate change. These are the most comprehensive scientific reports produced about climate change worldwide.
                Since 1990 these reports have consistently found that the Earth is warming, and that the release of greenhouse gases by humans is responsible.
                Driving policy action
                The five reports have been the cornerstone upon which international climate change negotiations have relied. 
                In 1990, the First IPCC Assessment Report played a decisive role in the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a key international treaty to reduce global warming and cope with the consequences of climate change. 
                The Second Assessment Report in 1995 led to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which further committed industrialised countries to limit and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to individually agreed targets. 
                Finally, the Fifth Assessment Report provided the foundation for the 2015 Paris agreement where 195 countries agreed to limit global warming to less than 2°C above preindustrial levels. 
                Bringing together the world’s best experts 
                Each Assessment Report includes analysis of several thousand published scientific papers, written and edited by the very best experts in their field. 
                For the latest three IPCC Special Reports, IPCC authors assessed around 20,000 publications and considered around 100,000 comments from more than 2,500 experts. 
                Many of these authors are funded by NERC, the driving force of investment in environmental science in the UK. 
                NERC scientists have authored and reviewed chapters in every single IPCC report to date, offering expertise in:
                <ul>
                 <li>Climate history</li> 
                 <li>Loss of ice from ice sheets and glaciers</li>
                 <li>Ocean circulation and ocean warming</li>
                 <li>Climate modelling</li>
                 <li> Sea level rise</li>
                </ul>
                Data from key figures of the Summary for Policymakers section of the latest IPCC report are now available for anyone to access from the CEDA Archive. This is the first time SPM figure data has been available on the same day as report publication.
                The next Assessment Report is due in 2022.</p>

            <h2>1992 - Coral reefs at threat</h2>
            <p class="left">Scientists realise that higher levels of CO2 in the ocean will make it<br /> harder for corals and other animals to build reefs
                When CO2 dissolves<br /> in the ocean, it raises the water's acidity level. 
                This stops corals from<br /> sucking in a vital mineral called calcium carbonate, which they use to<br /> build their skeletons. 
                US scientists Professor Stephen Smith and<br /> Professor Robert Buddemeier were the first to warn of this consequence<br /> of ocean acidification. Since then, evidence that there's a problem has continued to mount. 
               <br /> It’s not just corals that are at risk; all creatures that form shells are in danger,<br /> including oysters, mussels, clams and some planktonic species. 
                For instance, research<br /> by Dr Steve Widdicombe from Plymouth Marine Laboratory has shown that<br /> burrowing heart sea urchins are extremely vulnerable to ocean acidification. 
                <br />If sea urchins were to die out, this would have far-reaching implications.<br /> That’s because these digging creatures act like earthworms, stirring up the<br /> seabed and releasing nutrients for other organisms to use.</p>

            <h2>2003 - Scientists link extreme weather to climate change</h2>
            <p class="left">A heatwave in Europe kills tens of thousands of people – scientists say that<br /> climate change is to blame
                Flash floods and heatwaves seem to be happening<br /> almost every year in Britain, but is this just a coincidence? 
                Up until a few years ago,<br /> it wasn’t possible to draw a link between extreme weather and climate change<br /> with any degree of accuracy. 
                However, that changed in 2004 when Professor Pete Stott,<br /> a scientist at the UK Met Office, published a paper in the scientific journal<br /> Nature showing that climate change had doubled the risk of the 2003 European heatwave<br /> that killed tens of thousands of people. 
                His finding led to a growing scientific movement<br /> called extreme event attribution. This is where researchers point to an extreme weather<br /> event and use climate modelling to say whether the likelihood of the event happening<br /> would be the same in a world without climate change. 
                Today’s scientists are able to<br /> calculate the impact of global warming on droughts, heatwaves and floods with remarkable accuracy.<br />
                One of the leading experts in the field of extreme event attribution is Dr Friederike Otto,<br /> Deputy Director of the UKRI-funded Environmental Change Institute (ECI) at the University of Oxford. 
                <br />Dr Otto showed that the 2018 heatwave that engulfed northern Europe was made twice as likely due to climate change.<br /> She also found that the risk of extreme rainfall in any given winter has risen by 25%.</p>

            <h2>2007 - The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet </h2>
            <p>Polar regions are warming twice as fast as the rest of the Earth, putting polar bears and other wildlife at risk
                The International Polar Year 2007-2008 was the largest campaign ever mounted to explore Earth’s polar regions. 
                Around 50,000 scientists, students and support staff from over 60 nations convened to unlock the secrets of the Arctic and Antarctic. 
                What they found was alarming. The Greenland ice sheet, parts of the Antarctic ice sheet, and Arctic sea ice are melting at rates that are unprecedented in the last 10,000 years. 
                Climate change is already having a measurable effect on lifeforms throughout the food chain, from microbes to polar bears. 
                The poles are also warming faster than the rest of the planet, one of the key predictions of climate models. 
                One of the reasons for this increased warming is due to something called Ice-albedo feedback. Ice is highly reflective, so a lot of solar radiation that hits the polar regions bounces back into space. 
                However, as the planet warms and ice caps melt, less light is reflected, leading to even more warming. 
                This is an example of 'positive feedback' in climate change, where warming accelerates further change. </p>

            <p>Up to one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, and many could die out within decades
                A 2019 report by the UN found that the number of native species on the planet has plummeted since 1900. 
                The report, written by 145 experts from 50 countries, is the most comprehensive assessment of global biodiversity ever to take place.
                It found that at least 680 vertebrate species have been driven to extinction since the 16th century. 
                The rate of species extinctions is also accelerating, with grave impacts on people around the world. 
                More than 40% of amphibian species are now at risk of extinction. Over a third of all marine mammals and 33% of reef-forming corals are also threatened. 
                The main factors driving this mass extinction are changes in land and sea use, direct exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution and the introduction of invasive alien species. 
                The assessment was compiled by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), often described as the “IPCC for biodiversity”. IPBES is an independent intergovernmental body which is made up of more than 130 governments.  
                The report was compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries over the past three years. Many of these experts were NERC-funded scientists, who have acted as editors and expert consultants for this report, and previous IPBES reports.</p>
