        <h2>What are the solutions to climate change?</h2>
        <p>Climate change is already an urgent threat to millions of lives – but there are solutions.<br /> From changing how we get our energy to limiting deforestation, here are some of the key<br /> solutions to climate change.</p>
        <br /><p>Core to all climate change solutions is reducing greenhouse gas emissions,<br /> which must get to zero as soon as possible.</p>
        <br /><p>Because both forests and oceans play vitally important roles in regulating our climate, increasing<br /> the natural ability of forests and oceans to absorb carbon dioxide can also help stop global warming.</p>

        <p>The main ways to stop climate change are to pressure government and business to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep fossil fuels in the ground: Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas – and the more that are extracted<br /> and burned, the worse climate change will get. All countries need to move their economies away from<br /> fossil fuels as soon as possible.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Invest in renewable energy:</b></em> Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is<br /> the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal<br /> and geothermal power.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Switch to sustainable transport:</b></em> Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels. Reducing<br /> car use, switching to electric vehicles and minimising plane travel will not only help stop climate<br /> change, it will reduce air pollution too.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Help us keep our homes cosy:</b></em> Homes shouldn’t be draughty and cold – it’s a waste of money, and<br /> miserable in the winter. The government can help households heat our homes in a green way – such as<br /> by insulating walls and roofs and switching away from oil or gas boilers to heat pumps.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Improve farming and encourage vegan diets:</b></em> One of the best ways for individuals to help stop climate<br /> change is by reducing their meat and dairy consumption, or by going fully vegan. Businesses and food<br /> retailers can improve farming practices and provide more plant-based products to help people make<br /> the shift.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Restore nature to absorb more carbon:</b></em> The natural world is very good at cleaning up our emissions,<br /> but we need to look after it. Planting trees in the right places or giving land back to nature through,<br /> ‘rewilding’ schemes is a good place to start. This is because photosynthesising plants draw down<br /> carbon dioxide as they grow, locking it away in soils.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Protect forests like the Amazon:</b></em> Forests are crucial in the fight against climate change, and protecting<br /> them is an important climate solution. Cutting down forests on an industrial scale destroys giant trees<br /> which could be sucking up huge amounts of carbon. Yet companies destroy forests to make way for<br /> animal farming, soya or palm oil plantations. Governments can stop them by making better laws.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Protect the oceans:</b></em> Oceans also absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which<br /> helps to keep our climate stable. But many are overfished, used for oil and gas drilling or threatened<br /> by deep sea mining. Protecting oceans and the life in them is ultimately a way to protect ourselves from<br /> climate change.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Reduce how much people consume:</b></em> Our transport, fashion, food and other lifestyle choices all have<br /> different impacts on the climate. This is often by design – fashion and technology companies, for<br /> example, will release far more products than are realistically needed. But while reducing consumption<br /> of these products might be hard, it’s most certainly worth it. Reducing overall consumption in more<br /> wealthy countries can help put less strain on the planet.</li>
            <br /><li><b><em>Reduce plastic:</b></em> Plastic is made from oil, and the process of extracting, refining and turning oil into<br /> plastic (or even polyester, for clothing) is surprisingly carbon-intense. It doesn’t break down quickly<br /> in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions. Demand for plastic is rising so<br /> quickly that creating and disposing of plastics will account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050<br /> (this is the emissions count we need to stay within according to the Paris agreement).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are world leaders doing to stop climate change?</h2>
        <p>With such a huge crisis facing the entire planet, the international response should be swift and decisive. Yet progress by world governments has been achingly slow. Many commitments to reduce carbon emissions have been set, but few are binding and targets are often missed.
            In Paris in 2015, world leaders from 197 countries pledged to put people first and reduce their countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris agreement has the aim of limiting global warming to well below 2ºC and ideally to 1.5°C.
            If governments act swiftly on the promises they made in the Paris climate agreement, and implement the solutions now, there’s still hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change.
            World leaders and climate negotiators meet at annual COPs – which stands for Conference of the Parties (the countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC).
            At COPs and other climate talks, nations take stock of their ability to meet their commitments to reduce emissions.
            Recently, talks have focused on climate finance – money to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and reduce emissions. Rich countries have pledged $100 billion in annual funding to help developing countries reduce emissions and manage the impacts of climate change. This is yet to materialise, and much more money is needed.
            As the impacts of climate change are increasing, important talks have also started on “loss and damage” funding. This is money needed by worst-impacted countries to deal with extreme weather and other climate change impacts.</p>
